# binaryCL_Keras

Keras is a high-level Python library for building and training deep learning models. It makes it easy to create and experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.

To configure a binary classification model with Keras, you first need to define a training dataset that contains the features and the target labels. The target labels should be either 0 or 1, indicating which class the data point belongs to.

Once you have defined your training dataset, you can use the Keras API to create a binary classification model. Keras provides a variety of pre-built models that you can use for binary classification, such as the Sequential model. You can also define your own custom model architectures.

Once you have created your model, you need to compile it. This involves specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics that you want to use.

The loss function measures how well the model is performing on the training data. The optimizer updates the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. The metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on both the training data and the test data.

Once your model is compiled, you can train it on the training data. This involves feeding the training data to the model and allowing it to learn the relationships between the features and the target labels.

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test data. This will give you an idea of how well your model will generalize to new data.
